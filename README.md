# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a server and basic informational site. The site is to include a server.js file and html pages with routing to change pages.

# 2/6/2024 Change model of project.

I initially created the server in app.js using http. I used html pages for each view of the site. In order to switch between pages, I would have needed to create routes using a switch statement. This code would not be clean or easy to read so I decided to change to using express and ejs view controller.
